    <h1 id="hello-welcome-to-my-site">Hello, welcome to my site!</h1>
<h2 id="my-name-is-hugo-onghai">My name is Hugo Onghai.</h2>
<p>I am a new grad from <strong>UCLA</strong> with a <strong>B.S. in Materials Engineering</strong>, <em>summa cum laude</em>. While earing this degree, I also explored upper division coursework in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. My growing interest in these fields&mdash;coupled with the growing relevancy of computing and data science techniques for materials science&mdash;motivated my current pursuit now of a <strong>M. Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong> at <strong>Cornell Tech</strong>. Here, I hope to further my understanding in chip design (FPGA and ASIC), ML/AI, and the certain topics fundamental to Operations Research such as linear and non-linear programming and probability theory. On one hand, I am eager to find how I can leverage these concepts to make exciting materials science advancements. On the other hand, I am curious to explore other applications of what I will learn, including high frequency trading algorithms, efficient circuit design, and even healthcare.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my site! I am very grateful. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me via my various modes of contact outlined in my resume below.</p>
