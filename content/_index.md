# Hello, welcome to my site!

## My name is Hugo Onghai.

I am a new grad from **UCLA** with a **B.S. in Materials Engineering**, *summa cum laude*. While earing this degree, I also explored upper division coursework in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. My growing interest in these fields---coupled with the growing relevancy of computing and data science techniques for materials science---motivated my current pursuit now of a **M. Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Cornell Tech**. Here, I hope to further my understanding in chip design (FPGA and ASIC), ML/AI, and the certain topics fundamental to Operations Research such as linear and non-linear programming and probability theory. On one hand, I am eager to find how I can leverage these concepts to make exciting materials science advancements. On the other hand, I am curious to explore other applications of what I will learn, including high frequency trading algorithms, efficient circuit design, and even healthcare.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my site! I am very grateful. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me via my various modes of contact outlined in my resume below.
